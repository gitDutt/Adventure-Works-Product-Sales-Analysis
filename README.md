# Adventure-Works-Product-Sales-Analysis
The project was expected to test technical skills in SAS base programming and business analytics skills.
This was a group project; we performed the project in a group of 4 members.
The processing for the project involved Data Import, Data Cleaning, Joining and Merging, Data Analysis, and producing a Project Report.
Use the AdventureWorks.csv file to run the code on SAS. 
Also find the Project Guidlines we used to build it.
